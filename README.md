# banme
NOTICE: This project is being redesigned in JS, with a similar technical infrastructure and different implementation.

BanMe was originally designed as a project using Markov chains to help users get banned from r/TheDonald! The project was
meant to challenge me to build my own Markov generator from scratch, after which point I realized that Reddit wasn't the best
platform to use it on. The project has since been migrated to Twitter and Heroku, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eskimopies/AMSAT).
